# Deep-Learning-Based-Stair-Segmentation-and-Behavioral-Cloning-for-Autonomous-Stair-Climbing
Code for "Deep Learning-Based Stair Segmentation and Behavioral Cloning for Autonomous Stair Climbing"

This repository contains the code for the above mentioned paper. The implementation is done in Fast.ai library, since it is very concise and simple to understand. (Earlier code was in Pytorch but then it has been subsequently moved to fastai for simplicity.)

The pipeline in the paper consist of two parts, namely semantic segmentation of stairs and then behavioral cloning for stair alignment. There are separate code files for both the tasks. Script for testing will soon be updated. Since the paper is not open sourced the authors encourage you to obtain the copy of the paper from this [link](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793351X1940021X).
